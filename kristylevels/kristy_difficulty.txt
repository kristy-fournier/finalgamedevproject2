Level 1:
	Fairly complex, should go near the middle-end
Level 2:
	Tutorial level, introduces cracked floors, should go after the other tutorials (level 7) if possible
Level 3:
	Easy-medium, originally meant to be a basic level after trapdoors are introduced
Level 4:
	Medium, not hard but has traps for players who don't look ahead. Ideally sort of early middle (level 16-18)
Level 5:
	Tutorial level, introduces keys, requires navigating 3 floors with holes to get the key and access the exit
	Possible tutorial text: "Hmm, a locked floor? Maybe you can find a key(./?/!)" (I can't decide on the punctuation)
Level 6:
	Most complex of my set, Requires following a path to get the key, return to the start, and follow a new path to fall onto the door
